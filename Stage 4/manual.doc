Appendix A - Automanted Test Results
This appendix documents the execution and results of the test_suite.py file developed.
These tests were made and executed using the built-in unittest framework to check core game logic functioned as intended.
This included move legality, outflanked token being flipped, game termination and AI functionality.

The tests were run from the Stage 3 folder using the following command:
    `python -m unittest discover`
And the results of this were as follows:
    (venv) ➜  Stage 3 git:(main) ✗ python -m unittest discover
    ....................
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 20 tests in 0.001s

    OK
All tests passed, including ones containing edge cases that previously caused errors during development. 
This confirmes intended game logic behaves as expected across all expected use.
